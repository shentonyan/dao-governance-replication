# Data

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

The raw files are **not** stored in this repository. They are the public OSF
files that accompany the article (project `q6snh`, <https://osf.io/q6snh/>).
Download the archive `q6snh-osfstorage-archive.zip`, unzip it, and put the six
CSV files in `data/raw/` (or point `DAO_DATA_DIR` at the folder that holds them).

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force data\raw | Out-Null
Expand-Archive -Path "$HOME\Downloads\q6snh-osfstorage-archive.zip" -DestinationPath data\raw
```

Terms of use for the data are those stated on the OSF project page.

## Column notes (inferred from the data, not from a data dictionary)

**Vote files**

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pod-categorical` (round 1) / `pod` (round 2) | Condition: `quadratic-equal`, `quadratic-early`, `ranked-equal`, `ranked-early`. `early` is the paper's 20/80 power distribution. |
| `votes_given` | Token budget: 100 (equal), 400 or 25 (20/80). |
| `choice_1` ... `choice_4` | Tokens placed on each proposal option (Fig. 1). |
| `phase` (round-2 file only) | `pilots` (8 rows), `round-1` (5), `round-2` (17), `round-3` (45). |

The round-2 file has no participant id. The file named `round3` is the
paper's round 2 (n = 75, matching Table 1).

**Governance survey.** `Q1_*` decision process (Fig. 5), `Q2_*` voting mechanism
(Fig. 6), `Q3_*` and `Q4_*` democratic-quality statements (Fig. 7, sub-scale
mapping not provided; an inferred one is in `vdem.py`). Answers are text such as `4: Agree`; the first data row
holds the question wording.

## Measured article values

Files in `data/paper_figures/` are measurements or readings of the published article's figures, not author data:

- `fig{5,6,7}_digitized.csv`: bar heights measured from the article's Figs 5-7 images (accuracy about +-0.015; see `docs/FIGURE_COMPARISON.md`, section 2).
- `fig3_segments.csv`: category shares read from the Fig. 3 vector graphic.
- `fig8_printed_cells.csv`: the 148 correlations printed in Fig. 8 (the article prints only cells with |r| >= 0.1).

## Committed pilot data

`data/silicon/pilot_ballots.csv` holds the 48 ballots of the exploratory LLM-voter pilot (24 induced-value voters per rule; see `docs/EXTENSIONS.md`, section 9). These are not OSF data and contain no personal information; the file name `pilot` marks it as a small, one-off exploration.
